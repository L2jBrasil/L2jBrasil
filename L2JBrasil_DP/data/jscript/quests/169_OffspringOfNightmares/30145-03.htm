I am currently studying<font color="LEVEL"> dark horrors</font>. These dark horrors are different in many ways from normal undead creatures. I think that perhaps dark horrors are monsters created by Shilen from the nightmares of the ancient ones, and are the personification of the most basic horrors ever known. The scythe that a dark horror holds represents death, and the sharp fangs like those found on evil creatures may have been objects of fear for the ancient ones ...<br>
I plan to conduct more actual tests, to prove my scientific theory. For this, I'm going to need a model. How about it, do you think you can get me a<font color="LEVEL"> skull of a dark horror</font>? You seem more than capable of handling this request with no difficulties ...?<br>
