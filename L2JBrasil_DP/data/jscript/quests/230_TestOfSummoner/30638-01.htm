<html><body>Summoner Basillia:<br>
Greetings, traveler. I am Basillia, a Summoner of the Ivory Tower. Good to see you.<br>
This area is where I was born... That makes it 30 years since I first left my hometown. Right now, I am studying on a new Summoner's magic, here.<br>
Without any further delay...pull out your card. I already know that you came to challenge me to a duel. I already called my assistant, Mimi the Cat.<br>
