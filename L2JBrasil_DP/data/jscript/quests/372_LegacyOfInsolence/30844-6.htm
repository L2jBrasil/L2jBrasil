OK, Listen carefully. Bring to me the blueprints of the Tower of Insolence. There are 13 of them.<br>
Take<font color="LEVEL"> Ancient Papyrs</font> from<font color="LEVEL"> Corrupt Sages, Erin Ediunces, Hallate's Inspectors, Platinum tribe Overlords, Platinum Guardian Prefects and Messenger Angels</font>. You must open those papyrs in order to see their contents. All i want are the blueprints...you can keep anything else you find on them.<br>
Bring me all of them and I'll give you a recipe for a pair of gloves, shoes or a hat. Is that clear? Now, please, get going.
