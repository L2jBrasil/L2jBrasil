Deliver these goods to the village people as indicated on this delivery list. It's not a hard task. Of course, you will be compensated for your trouble, so don't worry.<br>
Deliver that heavy wooden box to<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Jackson</font> at the weapons shop, and the bolts of cloth to<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Silvia</font> at the grocery store. And the clay pot should be delivered to<font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Keeper Rant</font>. Deliver the goods and collect<font color="LEVEL"> receipts of delivery</font>, then bring those receipts back to me. I thank you in advance.
