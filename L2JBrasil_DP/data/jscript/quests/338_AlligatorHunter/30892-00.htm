I'm sure you've heard the stories about Alligator Island?! Long ago, some alligators were brought over from Avella. They thrived and soon their numbers had multiplied to the point that the island they lived on became known as "Alligator Island".<br>
The residents of Heine are quite nervous having so many dangerous beasts nearby, but the alligators have resisted numerous attempts by forces of the castle to wipe them out. However, if one knows one is doing, quite a handsome profit can be made from them!<br>
Would you care to join us on alligator hunt?<br>
