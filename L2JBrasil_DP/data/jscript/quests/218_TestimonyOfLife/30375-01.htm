<html><body>Priest Adonius:<br>
Brother, did you come to see the<font color="LEVEL"> Andariel's Book</font>? Did you come to contemplate on the goodness of Einhasad contained in the bible? May the protection of the Goddess accompany you in your journey to seek the truth...<br>
But as days go by, there are more and more dark forces that are trying to destroy this precious book containing the tenet of light. That is why we can't take the bible outside, unfortunately. I hate to turn down the request of a brother, but neither can I disobey the rules of the religion.<br>
But don't be too disappointed, yet. We are making copies of the Endariel so that many people can get access to the truth it contains. Even at this moment, scores of Priests are copying each and every single letter of the bible on to lamb's skin. The completed ones will be sent to the guardians of the Mother Tree and the Einhasad shrines all around.<br>
I hope you can participate in the copying process.<br>
