Soon we will have to face a great difficulty which our future depends on. The Mother Tree... is dying... We must, even at the cost of any sacrifice, protect the Mother Tree.<br>
To overcome this hardship, Hierarch Asterios is calling for the young Elves to gather in the Elven Forest. You must also return to your homeland. But not yet. You are still... Unprepared. You still need to have more experience.<br>
