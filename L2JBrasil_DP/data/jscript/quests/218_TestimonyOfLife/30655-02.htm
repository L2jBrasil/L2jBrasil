It was the leto lizardmen who wrested the spear from the lake fairies. It is said that the Shamans and Chiefs of their group broke the spear into many pieces and divided them among themselves.<font color="LEVEL"> The spear was divided into six pieces: the blade, the shaft, and four jewels that adorned the handle... </font>.<br>
These wretched creatures are taking the pieces to the Immortal Plateau to throw them into the lava cave to destroy the spear forever. This hostility is not typical of the lizardmen... I am certain that someone is controlling them.<br>
But the most important matter is the recovery of the spear. My brother, I beseech you. Find the<font color="LEVEL"> Shamans and Chiefs of the Leto lizardman </font>, and recover all the pieces of the spear that they have taken from us. Time is of the essence. May Sayha of the Winds guide your way...
