<html><body>Seer Tanapi:<br>
Some time ago, the goblin grave robbers destroyed our ancestors' tomb and ran away with the<font color="LEVEL"> Scepter of Tantos</font>.<br>
As you know, the Tantos tribe was executed for high treason 100 years ago. But later on, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding caused by the wicked Dwarves' mischief and the Flame Lord mourned bitterly his mistake. Every year we hold a memorial service to seek forgiveness from our falsely charged brothers of Tantos and comfort their souls.<br>
If you recover the Scepter of Tantos, I am sure the Monarch will be very pleased. And the Mark of Glory will be yours for sure!<br>
