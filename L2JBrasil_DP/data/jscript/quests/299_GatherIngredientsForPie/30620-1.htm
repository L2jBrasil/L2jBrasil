The highest quality honey can be found in the beehive, but the insects that guard it are actually wasps! These wasps store honey in a organ called a honey sac inside their body. This is by far the finest honey, but it's extreamely scarce! To make a pie I'll need at least 100 honey sacs! Get them by killing<font color="LEVEL"> wasp leaders</font> and<font color="LEVEL"> wasp workers</font>.<br>
Get<font color="LEVEL"> 100 honey sacs</font> and bring them to me.
