You need mandragora essence? I do not know who you have come on behalf of, but if you need mandragora essence of the finest quality, you have come to the right person.<br>
I can prepare mandragora essence for you, but first you must bring me<font color="LEVEL"> forty mandragora roots</font>. You can easily obtain mandragora roots that have a red tint.<br>
However, rarely, there are also<font color="LEVEL"> white roots</font>. If I prepare the essence with only the white roots, I can obtain a clear, transparent fluid that is richer and stronger in taste compared to the red. If you bring forty white mandragora roots, I can make you clear mandragora essence.<br>
Since you are ignorant, I assume you do not know which part of the mandragora to collect. Take this illustrated book of botany to refer to when you gather the roots.
