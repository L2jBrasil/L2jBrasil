I see you have found forty mandragora roots. However, the number of white mandragora roots is far short of forty. If you are busy, I could make regular red essence with only the roots you have brought?<br>
Or will you go and collect more white roots? If you do, then I can make a clear mandragora essence that is richer and stronger in taste than regular essence.<br>
