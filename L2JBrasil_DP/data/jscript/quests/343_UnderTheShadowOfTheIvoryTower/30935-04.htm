The rules are simple:<br>
I will toss a coin in the air and you guess and call out which side you think it will land on, heads or tails.<br>
Let's try it. If you win the first round, you can either receive 10 Nebulite Orbs or play a second round. If you win in the second round, you can either receive 30 Nebulite Orbs or play a third round. As you keep winning rounds, the stakes will become progressively larger.<br>
Oh, there's one last thing I need to explain... If you lose you must give me 10 Nebulite Orbs. It's only fair, don't you think?<br>
