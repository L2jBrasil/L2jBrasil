Don't you relize that the Heine family is the most prominent family in all of Heine? For years they have dominated Innadril's commerce and it is rumored that their personal fortune has swelled to several billion adena. Now word comes that cargo belonging to Iason Heine, the patriarch of the Heine family has been stolen... Why am I telling you this. You can't do anything about it.<br>
(This is a quest that can only be undertaken by a character of level 32 or higher.)
