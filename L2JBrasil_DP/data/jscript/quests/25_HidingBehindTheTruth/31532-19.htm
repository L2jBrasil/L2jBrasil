<html><body>Maid of Lidia:<br>
I was hoping we would meet again. I forgot to tell you something very important.<br>
My body may be gone, but now I can live my own life and follow my own fate thanks to you.<br>
Hardin controlled the missing piece of my memory, but now it's complete. He no longer has any influence over me!<br>
I feel I got back my <font color="LEVEL">real self</font>. For that I am eternally grateful. That's what I wanted to say.<br>
