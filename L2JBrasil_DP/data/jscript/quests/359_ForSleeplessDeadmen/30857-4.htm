Fine. Just what i asked.. sixty corpses. Thank you very much! Now i'll be able to prepare a ceremony and purify these remains. I need to do this as quick as possible, so if you don't mind...<br><br>
Ah... sure we can talk but not now... I really need to focus all my attention into this purification...<br><br>Give me some minutes and we will discuss whatever you like to.
