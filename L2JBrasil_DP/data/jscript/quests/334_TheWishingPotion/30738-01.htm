Since I learned herbal medicine when I was young and started to make magic potions 20 years ago, people say that I'm the very best in my field. But I think I've still got a long way to go. There are many mysterious potions passed down only through the ancient lore that I haven't made yet. But hey, just a short time ago I came to know by accident where the secret method for making one of the mysterious potions is stored. There is a clue written inside the book that I have. So it would be good if you would help me...<br>
