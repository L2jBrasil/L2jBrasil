Yes. You are a wise man, indeed. Please find me these things. 20 Harpy Feathers, 10 Wyrm Wingbone, and 10 Windsus Manes... You can get them all from the magic creatures in Giran.<br>
Do you understand? The harpy which glides with the wind, the wyrm which makes a strong blast while it feathers, and the mane of the windsus blowing in the winds. All these materials are related to the wind, things which I need to control it...
