The singing flowers are said to root their golden seed near waterfalls or lakes, and seduce the stunned people with their beautiful voice. Two different kinds of singing flowers would never bloom close to each other.<br>
Perina, Rukal... and I investigated its location and we managed to agree on a few places. Those places are, the Fellmere Lake in Gludio, the waterfalls near the Ivory Tower of Oren, and somewhere in the southern part of Giran Castle Town.<br>
Did you get it? The singing flowers are bound to gather around the watery areas by its nature. Therefore, look around the 3 places that I had mentioned, and especially the watersides, lakes... are the places you need to pay good attention to. Take this amulet just in case. The singing flowers all possess small amounts of poison... This will help you.
