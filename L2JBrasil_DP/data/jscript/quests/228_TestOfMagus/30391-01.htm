So you, Rukal, heard the song as well. That's right, I've been hearing those melodies every night, recently. I've heard many songs before but I'm sure this one is no Human's voice.<br>
It seemed like the song was coming from all different directions. And from somewhere far away... Perhaps the voice belongs to the legendary 'singing flower'...<br>
