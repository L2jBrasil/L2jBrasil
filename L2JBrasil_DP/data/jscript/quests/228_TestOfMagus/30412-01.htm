<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br>
Nice to meet you, wise man of the magic world who manages the elements. I am the Wind Sylph, messenger of Zephyr, guide of the storms. Did you come to me to get the Tone of Wind, by any chance?<br>
The wind is an inessential figure, which nobody can get hold of... Do you think you can get a note consisting of such wind? Only I can give you the Tone of Wind So you must make a deal with me.<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 228_TestOfMagus 30412_1"> Accept the proposal for making a deal</a>
