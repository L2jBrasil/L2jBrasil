I don't understand why the Tetrarch ask an outsider like you to do this such a job. But I have never doubted Tetrarch Thifiell's wisdom and have carried out the rules with loyalty. Therefore, even though I don't really feel like it, I will help you. I will tell you the materials you must get from now on.<br>
First, go to the<font color="LEVEL"> Death Pass</font> and gather the blood of<font color="LEVEL"> Guardian Basilisk</font>. 10 bottles of blood is just enough for a<font color="LEVEL"> Basilisk Plasma</font>.<br>
Also, from the<font color="LEVEL"> Wasteland</font>, gather 10 aphids which you will be able to obtain by killing the<font color="LEVEL"> Ant Soldier</font>. If you do so, you'll be able to get the<font color="LEVEL"> Honey Dew</font>.<br>
Last, from the<font color="LEVEL"> Cruma Marshland</font>, catch the<font color="LEVEL"> Marsh Stakato</font> and gather 10 bottles of their body fluids. By doing so, a<font color="LEVEL"> Stakato Ichor</font> will be made. When these 3 things are ready bring them back to me.</body></html>
