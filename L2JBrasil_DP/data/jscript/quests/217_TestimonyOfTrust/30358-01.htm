<html><body>Tetrarch Thifiell<br>
May the mercy of Shilen be with you. 	I am the chosen by Gran Kain, the Father of shadow, and Shilen, the Mother of the abyss. On behalf of the Patriarch, who was sealed by those hypocrites who follow the light. I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. I am Tetrarch Thifiell, who released brothers from the underground place of exile and recaptured the shadow forest from Elves. Son of Human, why did you come to see me?<br>
