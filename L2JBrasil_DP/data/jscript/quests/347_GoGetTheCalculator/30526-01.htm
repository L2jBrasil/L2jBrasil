Over the long years of trading, the dwarves have created a tool to help traders with their calculations. At first it was a very simple device, but over time they were able to make them better and capable of more complex computations. I find this very useful and I always wish to get the latest model of this<font color="LEVEL"> calculator</font>. Recently a new one was created. I heard it has been brought to town but I have not seen it yet. I do not know where to look for it, but I am sure the<font color="LEVEL"> Trader Guilds</font> brought it into town.<br>
As you probably already know, there are two trader guilds in this village: the<font color="LEVEL"> Silver Scale Guild</font> and the<font color="LEVEL"> Golden Wheel Guild</font>.<br>
I do not have the time to go and search for it. Do you think you can check the leaders and people from these guilds to find me the<font color="LEVEL"> newest model calculator</font>? I will, of course, pay you for your efforts.<br>
