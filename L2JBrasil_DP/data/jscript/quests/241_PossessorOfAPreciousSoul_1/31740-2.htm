My group has built monuments to the Heroes in many towns, and have restored the Grand Olympiad Games to the splendor of the era of giants. 
Visit Head Blacksmith Noel at his shop. He's an expert on adapting ancient weapons for modern-day Heroes. 
He's been having problems lately, however. Please go and see if you can help him.
