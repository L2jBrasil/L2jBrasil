<html><body>Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>
A voice comes out of the sphere in a pleading tone:<br>
I was once a human like yourself. A powerfull spell perished my body, and my very soul was trapped in this place.For several hundred years, I've been working here as a gatekeeper. They have even taken away my memory, and therefore I don't even know what kind of person I used to be. The only thing I remeber is that I need to open the gate to the Lord of the Seal.<br>
