The followers of ancient magic possess<font color="LEVEL"> scrolls of ancient magic </font>containing forbidden magic power. If these scrolls were to fall into the wrong hands, it could cause quite a disturbance. I cannot let this happen.<br>
Please recover the scrolls of ancient magic from the ancients in the dungeon...Will you do this for me?<br><br>
