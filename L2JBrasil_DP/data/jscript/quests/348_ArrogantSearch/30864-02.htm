<html><body>Magister Hanellin:<br>
You have seen it, too! Haven't you? I'm talking about mysterious, swirling vortex over the tower of an ancient king. Do you wander what it is? I can tell you and I can teach you many other things, if you'd like to work for me. <br>
I don't need too much from you...just run a few errands for me, find me few items...and then you can choose whether you want to find some items for my clients and be rewarded, or even keep the items for your own use. What do you think?<br>
