You are back again...but you are not done with the last task I asked of you. Listen carefully: 
You need to dip the cloth in the blood of a<font color="LEVEL"> Platinum Tribe Overlord</font> or a<font color="LEVEL"> Platinum Tribe Shaman</font>. Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come back to me and I promise to tell you a secret.
