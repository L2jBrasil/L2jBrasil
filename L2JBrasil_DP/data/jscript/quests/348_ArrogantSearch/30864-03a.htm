You are not thinking about quiting already, do you? Have you forgotten what I asked of you? Here is what I wish of you for now: go to the Giants Cave, defeat a<font color="LEVEL"> Lesser Giant Elder</font> or a<font color="LEVEL"> Lesser Giant Mage</font> and bring back the Titan's Powerstone that they carry. I only need one stone, so it shouldn't be too hard for you.
