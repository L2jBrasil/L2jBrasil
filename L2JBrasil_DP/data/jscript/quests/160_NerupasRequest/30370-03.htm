Recently, one of your kind who lives in the village visited me and asked me to get some<font color="LEVEL"> silvery spider silks</font> for him. My sisters have combed the forest and collected spider webs spun by silver spiders. But I detest going into the village. I would like it if you could deliver them for me instead. Would you do that for me?<br>
