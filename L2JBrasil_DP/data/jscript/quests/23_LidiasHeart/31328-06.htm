<html><body>Innocentin:<br>
These days the Silver Spear is awarded to whomever distinguishes himself suppressing the insurrection. One is held by
the King's royal escort, who recently caught and executed a traitor, and the other spear is held by someone else...
someone who dealt mercilessly with the undead insurrection and expelled the filthy devil worshippers!<br>
You'll find him in the temple of Rune Castle Town.<br>
Don't ask me any more. Take your clues and go find out where the key can be used.
