It's very simple. There are 70 cards, made up of 5 suits 
with 14 characters in each suit. You can draw 5 cards from the 
lot, and if you get one of the combination of cards below, 
you can be rewarded.<br>
<br>
Five of a kind: Five cards containing the same character.<br>
Four of a kind: Four cards containing the same character.<br>
Full house: Three cards with the same character along with two cards with the same character.<br>
Three of a kind: Three cards with the same character.<br>
Two pairs: Two pairs of cards with the same characters in each pair.<br>
One pair: Two cards with the same charater.<br>
<br>
If you don't have any of the hands I just mentioned, it's called having 
"no pair", and you don't get anything. Of course, a five of a kind is rare, 
so the reward for getting it is high; on the other hand, one pair is the easiest 
hand to get, so you'll receive only the lowest reward.
