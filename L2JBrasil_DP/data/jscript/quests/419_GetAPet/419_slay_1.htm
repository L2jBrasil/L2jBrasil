<html><body>Pet Manager Martin:<br>Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh, I just remembered that you were an Elf! In that case, I would 
like you to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters 
there. How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it?<br>
If you go to the Elven Forest, you'll be able to find<font color="LEVEL"> 
the crimson spider, hook spider and pincer spider</font>. 
They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in the Elven forest. 
They say that they devour the animals every day. There are hardly any 
animals left near where they live.<br>Therefore you should go and get rid of them.
By the way, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that you killed 
the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come back with nothing to prove 
your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!</body></html>
