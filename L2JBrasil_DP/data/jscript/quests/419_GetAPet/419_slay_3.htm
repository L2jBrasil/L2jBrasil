Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh, I just remembered that you were one of the Orcs! 
In that case, I would like you to go to your hometown 
and get rid of the animal slaughters there. How does 
that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it?<br>
If you go to the Indomitable Plateau of your hometown, 
you'll confront<font color="LEVEL"> the kasha spider, 
kasha fang spiders and kasha blade spiders</font>. 
They are the most wicked animal slaughterers in 
the area. They say that they devour the animals every day. 
There are hardly any animals left near where they live.<br>
Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By the way, 
when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that you 
killed the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you 
come back with nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything 
is clear, be off!</body></html>
