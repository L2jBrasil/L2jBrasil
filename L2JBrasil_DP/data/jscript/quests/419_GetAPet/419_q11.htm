Normally, how would a wolf's tail be positioned?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 419_GetAPet right">It's tail is always pointing straight down.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 419_GetAPet wrong">It's tail is always curled up.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 419_GetAPet wrong">It's tail is always wagging back and forth.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 419_GetAPet wrong">What are you talking about?! A wolf doesn't have a tail.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 419_GetAPet wrong">No answer</a><br>
