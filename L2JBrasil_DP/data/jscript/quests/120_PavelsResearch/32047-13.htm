All I know is that Dr. Chaos operated some kind of device.<br>
According to my memory, the device was meant<font color="LEVEL"> to control the weather </font>around Pavel. <br>When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was to activate this device. <br>
I think perhaps the last mode in which it operated was<font color="LEVEL"> N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring. </font> <br>
