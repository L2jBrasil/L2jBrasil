My undying thanks! A thousand blessings upon you! Here is what I offer in exchange. It was a gift from my grandfather, Toma. He gave it to me when I left for here to make my investigation.  I think you will find it helpful where you're going next - no, don't ask why. I just have a sense about these things.<br>
Farewell, brave adventurers! May your reputations and fortunes grow, so that I can boast of having known you! I will drink to you in every pub in my hometown!
