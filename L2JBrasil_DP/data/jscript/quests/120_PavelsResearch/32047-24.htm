After making the Gigantic Golem, Dr. Chaos became obsessed with its power.<br>
Perhaps this happened because the Doctor was exposed to the Flames of Pa'agrio for too long.<br>
It is said that they are the flames of the gods themselves; no mere mortal can remain unscathed after bathing in them. They can be found within the Giant Research Wing.<br>
Those flames will not necessarily affect a creature created directly by the gods since they are already kin to the divine power. But be warned — the creatures of the gods view each other as enemies... they will likely treat you likewise if you encounter them while in possession of the Flames of Pa'agrio.<br>
