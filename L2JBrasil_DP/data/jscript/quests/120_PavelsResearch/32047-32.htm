I have no more to say to you. Please tell the Dwarf what I said.<br>
There is no more danger here; you have resolved all of the problems.<br>
I am being operated by a Starstone, but once that Starstone disappears, I will begin to be deactivated. I am looking forward to it — I want to rest, at long last.<br>
Please take this. It is all I have left to give.
