Haven't you left yet? I'm telling you again, most of the creatures around here have a Black Ice Crystal in their bodies! It seems like those crystals make them very violent. We need to study those crystals. Bring me some and you'll be well-rewarded! Of course, you probably won't get a Black Ice Crystal at first. You'll get a Silver Ice Crystal. Bring me some Silver Ice Crystals and I'll reward you for them, too. <br>
