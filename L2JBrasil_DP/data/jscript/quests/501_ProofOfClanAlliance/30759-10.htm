Tick tick tick tick… time is running out quickly. What in the world happened to your clan members? Will they be able to save your life in time? We don’t have much time left until the time of your death…<br>
Let me remind you again.<font color="LEVEL"> When your clan members bring back all the ingredients, you should gather them up yourself. Then take them with you and come to see me in person. Then, I will use the ingredients to make the antidote for you.</font>
