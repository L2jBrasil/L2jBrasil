<html><body>Sir Kristof Rodemai:<br>
What do you think of the current state of affairs? The royal authority at the center has been severely undermined to the point of losing its controlling power and revolts are breaking out everywhere. Even the evil spirits are making sinister movements.<br>
...Well, I guess it’s useless to talk about this with you. However, if you belong to a clan, I would like to discuss this matter with your clan leader.<br>
(This quest can be received only by a clan lord of a level 3 clan.)
