I like you. Even with just one glance, I can tell that you are leadership material, one who can lead a large group of followers. However, unless you want people to whisper among themselves that you just put together some wanderers and beggars… you will need to prove your clan’s capability by some objective way.<br>
Hmm… what would be good…<br>
How about this? There is a witch called Calis who lives near the Ivory Tower. People say that she gives a test to discern a true hero. People around me have told me that those who have passed her test are enjoying wide recognition as true heroes. If your clan can pass the test, nobody will find fault with you any more. What do you think? Do you think you can do it?<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest 501_ProofOfClanAlliance 30756-04.htm">Tell him that you will not proceed.</a>
