Blacksmith Kluto:<br>
Oh! Do you want to be an Artisan? I see you've already passed the first test! That Silvery, who gave you the first test, has a strange way of speaking, but she's actually quite a good-natured girl. Traveling has changed her accent though ... oh well ...<br>
My son is infatuated with that girl these days. He's quite a good boy, not just because he's my son ... What do you think? Do you think you can help my son?<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest 418_PathToArtisan 30317_2">Look here, sir, I'm here to take a test!</a>
