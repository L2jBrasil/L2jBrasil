<html><body>[Dark Mystic Class Transfer]:<br>
When a Dark Mystic reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. After successfully completing the quest and attaining level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Dark Wizard or Shillien Oracle. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Wizard</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Varika</font>. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Oracle</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Sidra</font>. Varika is located in the Dark Elven Village near <font color="LEVEL">the Altar of Rites</font>, and Magister Sidra is located in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio Castle Town</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
