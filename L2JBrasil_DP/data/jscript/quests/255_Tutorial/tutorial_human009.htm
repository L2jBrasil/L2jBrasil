From now on, you will receive the benefits of being a <font color="LEVEL">New Character</font>. <br>
Until you reach level 25, you will receive the following advantages:<br>
1. Equipment exchange:<br1>
You can trade your current weapon or armor for higher quality equipment, paying only the difference in price. In order to initiate the trade, start a conversation with any merchant at a weapons or armor shop.<br>
2. Support magic:<br1>
You may ask a Newbie Guide to cast Support Magic on you, which can be very helpful when fighting monsters. You may receive Support Magic between levels 8 and 39.<br>
3. You can also receive additional Soulshots and Spiritshots specially designed for beginners.<br1>
Each time you complete a particular quest as a newbie, you will also receive an additional reward. Now, go find <font color="LEVEL">Captain Gilbert</font> in Talking Island Village. He will give you the details of a quest that requires you to defeat the Orcs and Werewolves on Talking Island. <br>
If you complete this quest, you will receive additional <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots or Spiritshots that are meant for beginners</font>.<br>
