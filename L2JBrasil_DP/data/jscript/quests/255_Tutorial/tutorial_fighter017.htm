Congratulations! You have finally reached level 5.<br>
Now you can learn a new skill. To learn a skill, you must meet the <font color="LEVEL">Master in the town.</font> Follow the arrow above your head to find him.<br>
In order to learn a skill, a certain number of <font color="LEVEL">Skill Points (SP)</font> is required. Your SP will grow every time you kill a monster, so if you ever run out of SP, you can earn more by hunting monsters.<br>
To see your current SP level, open the <font color="LEVEL">Character Information Window</font>. If you click the <font color="FF0000">icon that looks like a face</font> or press the ALT+T keys, the Character Information Window will open.<br>
