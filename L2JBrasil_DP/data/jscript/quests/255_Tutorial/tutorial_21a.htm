<html><body>[Human Mystic Class Transfer]:<br>
When a Human Mystic reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. Upon successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Human Wizard or Cleric. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, specialized and powerful. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Human Wizard</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font>. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Cleric</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt</font>. <br>
Both are located in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
