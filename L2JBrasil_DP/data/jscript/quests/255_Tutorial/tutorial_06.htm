Good work. Now we will learn about clicking the mouse wheel.<br>
Try clicking the <font color="LEVEL">mouse wheel</font>. By clicking the wheel, your viewpoint changes to a frontal view. If you're already looking straight forward, clicking the wheel will switch directions so you're looking straight back.<br>The rearward view will help you in situations such as running away from a monster, or to determine how far you have traveled. Also, it will help you maintain a uniform distance from other characters.<br>
