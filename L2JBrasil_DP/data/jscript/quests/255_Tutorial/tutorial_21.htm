<html><body>[Human Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
When a Human Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. Upon successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of three classes. The choices are Warrior, Knight or Rogue. After a class transfer, a character has more diverse, specialized and powerful skills. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Warrior</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Master Auron</font>. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Knight</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font>. <br>
And, in order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Rogue</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique</font>. All three are located in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully before selecting your class and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
