<html><body>[Elven Mystic Class Transfer]:<br>
When an Elven Mystic reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. After the character successfully completes the quest and attains level 20, the Mystic can transfer to one of two classes: either Elven Wizard or Elven Oracle. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizard</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Rosella</font>. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Oracle</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel</font>. <br>
Both are located in the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
