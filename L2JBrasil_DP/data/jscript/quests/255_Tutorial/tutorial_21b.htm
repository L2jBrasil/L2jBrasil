<html><body>[Elven Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
When an Elven Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. Upon successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: an Elven Knight or an Elven Scout. After a class transfer, the character's skills become more diverse and specialized. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius</font>. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Scout</font> you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Master Reoria</font>. <br>
Both are in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio Castle Town</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
