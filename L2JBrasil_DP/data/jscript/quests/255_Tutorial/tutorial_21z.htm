Good work.<br>
Next time rest when your HP or MP are low.<br>
But remember, when you sit down to rest you must find a place where monsters will not attack you. When sitting down, it takes time to stand up after you are attacked, slowing down your counterattack and allowing you to take more damage.<br>
