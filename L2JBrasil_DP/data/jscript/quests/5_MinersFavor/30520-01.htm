The item Bolter entrusted ...? Ohh! You mean the beer he entrusted a few weeks ago! Now where did I put it ... Ah! Here it is!. Dion-made<font color="LEVEL"> redstone beer</font>! A nice sip of this when you're thirsty ... and ... Ah! Yes! Just thinking of it makes me refreshed!<br>
Right ... I should not waste my time like this! I am very busy organizing my account book ... Take the beer and give it to Bolter!
