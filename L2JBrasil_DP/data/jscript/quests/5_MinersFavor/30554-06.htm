You've done well, young friend. Thanks to you, my guild brothers here can live comfortably for a few weeks. This is all thanks to you. Take this as a token of gratitude. It is nothing fancy, but it will be very useful in an emergency.<br>
What do you think, young friend? If you have time, would you like to drink a cold redstone beer with me?
