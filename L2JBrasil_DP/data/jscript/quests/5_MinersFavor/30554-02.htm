<html><body>Miner Bolter:<br>
My Gray Column Guild specializes in architecture and mine development. This strip mine is also under our control. Those hard-working miners over there are all my guild brothers.<br>
Everyone is familiar with soil and rocks, so they like to stay here rather than in the village. But sometimes, we have to go to the village to get daily necessities. You don't know how troublesome it is. Will you do me a favor? All you need to do is to go to the village and bring me a few things. What do you think? It's not that difficult, right?<br>
