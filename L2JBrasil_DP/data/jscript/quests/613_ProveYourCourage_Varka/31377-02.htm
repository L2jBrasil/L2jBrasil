<html><body>Chief Ashas Varka Durai:<br>
I must find a worthy fighter who can defeat Hekaton of the Ketra Orcs! Sadly, I don't think you're up to the task! Sigh... It seems like they're all too young or too old...<br>
(Only a character who possesses the mark of Varka's friend - 3rd level can undertake this quest.)
