<html><body>Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
Right now, people in Giran, are very much disturbed by the earth dragon Antharas. That's because the rumor is going around that Antharas who has been hibernating for a long time has finally awoken. Aristocrats and traders who are real power brokers in Giran are busying themselves with some absurd armchair arguments such as the idea that they will hire and dispatch mercenaries to subdue the dragon. We are in a situation that drakes and wyrms can pour out of the Dragon's Valley at any moment. We cannot trust such incompetent people to solve this crisis.<br>
In order to find a way to solve this problem, I started an enterprise in Giran. It is not anything great. But who knows. It could potentially be the first step toward the solution of the problem.First, go to<font color="LEVEL"> Giran Castle Town</font>and meet with a man called<font color="LEVEL"> Martien</font>who is taking care of my business affairs. I have trust in him so cooperate with him fully. You can hear about the details from Martien in person. I will pray that God's divine protection will be with you and your clan.
