Well, our time together has come to an end... Some day I hope your clan will become strong enough to establish peace on the continent. I will be gladly looking forward to that day. Now, I will give your clan the Proof of Aspiration. When king Rauhel was alive, this token used to be bestowed to a promising young lord who was expected to realize a big aspiration. If you show this to a high priest in a temple or grand master of a warrior guild, you will receive help in growing your clan's power.
