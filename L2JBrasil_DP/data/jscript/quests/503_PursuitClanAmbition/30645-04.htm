The land dragon will awaken soon. The survival of Giran... No, the fate of the entire kingdom rests on this grave matter. Hurry and go to<font color="LEVEL"> Dragon Valley</font>. Please get me<font color="LEVEL"> thunder wyrm eggs, drake eggs, blitz wyrm eggs and mist drake eggs</font> there.And just one or two is not enough. I'll need<font color="LEVEL"> 10 of each</font>. Regardless of the difficulty, I really need you to get those for me. And I'll tell you one more thing... Blitz wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare types and so it will be very difficult to find them. And if you happen to meet the Dwarves that I sent previously, you may be able to get hints from them. OK, good luck.
