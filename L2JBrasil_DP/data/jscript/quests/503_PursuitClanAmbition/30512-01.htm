I've heard rumors about you. That you are a clan with a lot of power... I also heard you are headed over to Dragon Valley...? I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you find my younger sibling? He's someone that has obtained the respectable title of Master Raider... They say he is going around with some bad ones that are called the<font color="LEVEL"> Magpie Brothers.</font>It's said they were hired by the Human royalty to find something in Dragon Valley... This seems like a foul-smelling matter...
