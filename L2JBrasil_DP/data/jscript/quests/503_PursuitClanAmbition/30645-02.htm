I'm sure you already heard from Atebalt. The land dragon Antharas is waking up. Most people say that it's a rumor but they are just saying this because that's what they hope, not because it really is a rumor. According to information from Atebalt, the awakening of Antharas is almost a certain thing. Sooner or later, the land dragon will wake up completely. And when that happens, the wyrms and drakes that roam around Dragon Valley will be led to their leader and will follow Antharas like soldiers on the battlefield to turn this whole area around into a field overgrown with mugwort.<br>For the sake of Giran, we must come up with a plan to counter this. A team to suppress the land dragon would be useless. Indeed, the very idea of opposing Antharas by some common-sense approach is an idea that is itself nonsense. We've got to find a way to fight the evil creatures of Antharas. There was a counterplan that we set up before on our own but rather than calling it a counterplan, I should say that it was really just a defense measure. Fortunately, Atebalt heard something and said that he will give us support.<br>
