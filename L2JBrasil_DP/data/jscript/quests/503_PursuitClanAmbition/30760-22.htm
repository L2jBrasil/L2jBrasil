What, what did you say?! You stupid...! Are you being foolhardy? Or, being a hypocrite? I didn't judge you correctly. I thought you were my kind of person...<br>I heard a rumor that the Black Legion is after this object. You don't have the power to guard it against them. I really don't think you can keep it from being taken away from you... You will die... Your entire clan will be killed!
