Now, listen to me well... grave of the empire, grave keeper, key guardian, a set of 6 keys, the great king of grave lookouts... his footsteps can freely pass through the walls of time and space. However if you pierce him with a two-pronged spear, you will be able to bring him down. Then, the stick of a ruler will become yours... within the boundary of the law of cause and effect, this is all the wisdom I am allowed to give you. But if you make a request, everything will become only part and... I can tell you a new story...<br>
