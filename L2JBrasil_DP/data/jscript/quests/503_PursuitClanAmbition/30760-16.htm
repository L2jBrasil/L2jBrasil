<html><body>Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
A lot of things have happened since then. Some ominous rumors have become the talk of the town with the people such as ...a punitive force to be dispatched to the Lair of Antharas has been formed and evil spirits are acting up in several parts of the kingdom. People are saying that the destruction of the world is near and the god of destruction is upon us.And warlords have started to battle against each other over the privilege of ruling each territory. Finally the time of great upheaval has come upon us. Although this is sooner than expected, I think we had better wrap up the work that we have been preparing in a hurry. Have you heard anything about the <br><font color="LEVEL">'Scepter of Judgment'</font>? People say that a lord who obtains this object will never get defeated in war. Of course this is an absurd false rumor. But, the problem is that because of this rumor, not only soldiers but even lay people are being influenced by it...<br>Take this letter with you and go see<font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town</font>. The knights of the Rodemai family are all my faithful servants. Therefore you can trust him and offer him your service willingly. You can hear about the details of the situation from Sir Rodemai in person. Now, I pray that God's divine protection will be with you and your clan.
