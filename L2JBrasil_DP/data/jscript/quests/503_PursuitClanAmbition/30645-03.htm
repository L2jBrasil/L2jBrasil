I am gathering the eggs of wyrms and drakes in order to understand their condition. I have gotten advice from various pet managers who are experts about this kind of thing and I am planning to investigate these eggs. I have already sent several Dwarven Master Raiders to<font color="LEVEL"> Dragon Valley</font> to collect eggs. But even though it's been a week since they left, they still haven't returned. It seems to have been too much for them. Please go to the valley and collect eggs. Kindly get me 10 each of<font color="LEVEL"> thunder wyrm eggs, drake eggs, blitz wyrm eggs and mist drake eggs</font>. Blitz wyrms and mist drakes are extremely rare types and so it will be very difficult to find them. And if you happen to meet the Dwarves that I sent previously, you may be able to get hints from them. OK, good luck.
