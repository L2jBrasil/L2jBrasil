You must have heard about this already. It is rumored that the lord who obtains the scepter will never be defeated in a war. This may be just an old wife's tale. But if the scepter really exists, just possessing will boost our soldiers' morale. Don't you think? However, where are we supposed to go find this object of legend... We already took this matter to dwarven bounty hunters who are the experts in the excavation of relics but even they have not come up with any clue regarding its whereabouts. My father has been just telling me that I should also seek <font color="LEVEL">witches' advice </font>regarding this matter...<br>
