They are useless ones that don't hesitate to commit disrespect to the ancestors. They are Master Raiders that dig up graves and go through the relics to collect whatever items look like they will sell for a price. They like anything that is shiny and so they got the nickname of the Magpie Brothers. They stole the relics of the old Dwarven kingdom at the ancient labyrinth of Schuttgart and then shamelessly sold them to collectors at high prices. The most magnificent relics of our race...! The Magpie Brothers were expelled from the kingdom for that. In other words, they came into the Aden kingdom and took the relics of the Elmoreden Empire from the National Cemetary... I heard that recently they joined hands with some Human royalty and have been engaging in the work of collecting eggs in Dragon Valley...
