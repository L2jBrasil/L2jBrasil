I've heard about you from Sir Athebaldt. He was saying that your clan would help me in my research. So you're wanting to know what I'm researching? Alright, I'll tell you! Recently, I've been all caught up in developing a new type of golem with my old friend Tajif Goldgedder! If things are completed according to the current design, I'll be able to create a scary thing that can break through any castle wall in one shot no matter how strong the castle wall is! Let's wait and see!<br>
