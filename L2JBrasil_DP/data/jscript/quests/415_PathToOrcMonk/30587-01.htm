Gantaki Zu Urutu:<br>
Young one, do you know of the Paagrio Monks that carry out the teachings of Paagrio to achieve ultimate strength? They do not rely on equipment but believe that training their own bodies as weapons is the key to acquiring ultimate power. For this, they practice the Kabart, a traditional martial art of the Orcs that has been passed on for thousands of years.<br>
The training process of a Paagrio Monk is a perilous path that can only be taken by one with faith like a flame and a strong body like steel. However, the strength you acquire as a result is indeed amazing. Kabart Masters can strike down a large beast with one blow, using no swords or axes, just swift movements and precise blows.<br>
