Basically, an abyss jewel is a device 
that absorbs the ambient magic of darkness. The succubus gang is using that 
power to destroy the aura that binds Antharas. There is no time to waste, for if 
this well-rested beast is allowed to escape it will be disastrous. Do you 
understand the gravity of the situation? We must destroy the abyss jewel!<br>
Word comes that the abyss jewel is currently in the <font color="LEVEL">southern 
border region of the Sea of Spores</font>, protected by the spirits of darkness. 
These spirits are not only fearsome guards, but also have the power to 
recreate the jewel from fragments if it is destroyed. Therefore, you must not 
only destroy the abyss jewel, but you must also obliterate every last one of 
those spirits of darkness that protect it. Bring back the <font color="LEVEL">
fragments of the jewel</font> and <font color="LEVEL">proof of having killed 
the spirits of darkness that guard it</font>, then you shall have your proof 
of guardian.</body></html>
