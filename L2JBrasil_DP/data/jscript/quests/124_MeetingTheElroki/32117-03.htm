Lost to my people's memory, unremembered and unknown, I, Elrokian of old, speak with you!<br>
The wisdom of the ancestors is this: find the egg laid by the dinosaur Mantarasa. The love of the gods has bestowed it with the gift of immortality and healing. Make your mind light as the bird's feather and clean as the morning sun, and go north.<br>
The<font color="LEVEL"> Mantarasa Egg</FONT> is on<font color="LEVEL"> the border between the Primeval Plains and the Lost Nest</FONT>. Only the Mantarasa Egg can save these poor children of the Elroki. May their glory return to them!
