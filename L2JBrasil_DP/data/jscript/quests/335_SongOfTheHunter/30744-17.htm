We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should see <font color="LEVEL">Guild Member Tor</font>, he will know  what requests have come in.  If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.<br>Hunters are also hired by individuals, not just through the guild. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter.  Would you care to meet him?<br>
