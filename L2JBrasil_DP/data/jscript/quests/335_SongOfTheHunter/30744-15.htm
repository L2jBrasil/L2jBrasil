You are already applying for the 2-circle hunting license? Nice to see that you don't lack ambition!  But look. You're not ready. You do have some skills but you still need more important practical experience. For the time being, you should develop your talents while carrying out hunting requests.<br>
(You can apply for the 2-circle license test after reaching level 45.)</body></html>
