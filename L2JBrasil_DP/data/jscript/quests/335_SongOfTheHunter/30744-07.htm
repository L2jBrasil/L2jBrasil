You must kill the three evil outlaw Haka brothers and bring back their heads. They are named <font color="LEVEL">Haka, Jakja and Marka</font>.  They are prefects of the Breka orc tribe. They wantonly attack merchants' carriages, massacre citizens and set fire to their homes. There has been a bounty placed by on their heads by the Lord of Giran, therefore they have been laying low. But with the <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orc Warriors</font> destroyed, they are bound to appear seeking revenge.<br>
