You have obtained the items from the list! I must admit that I doubted you at first, but I stand corrected! Well, you certainly qualify as a hunter. I hereby bestow on you the 1-circle hunting license.  Welcome to the guild, new hunting brother!<br>Now you are qualified to perform the various tasks that come to our Hunters Guild. Please go and ask <font color="LEVEL">Guild Member Tor</font> over there for details.<br>Sometimes you will be assigned jobs by the guild, other times you'll be hired by individuals. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter; would you like to meet him?</body></html>
