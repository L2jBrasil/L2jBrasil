Many aspire to join our guild. Many such as you only see the glamorous side of our profession.<br>Becoming a hunter is not an easy task. Only the very best and brightest are selected for membership in the Hunters Guild.  A hunting license is only given to those who pass a very severe test.<br>Many give up before a week has passed. Does that sound like you?<br>
