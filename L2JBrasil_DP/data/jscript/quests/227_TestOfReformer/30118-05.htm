<html><body>Priestess Rupino:<br>
The nail that was hammered into Aruraune's head was to brainwash the untamable Mandragora. I can see no difference between the person who hammered a nail into that poor creature's head and the Priests who are brainwashing ignorant people with their tenets... Or perhaps we too, are already brainwashed...?<br>
Now... I want you to meet someone. She was a former Priestess of this shrine but was dismissed after being accused of paganism. I was afraid, and couldn't dare to give up my present status and social relations so I denied thinking deeply about her message. If you have the courage to carry through your beliefs, you should go and talk to her.<br>
