Ah! You brought it back for me! It's the "kaldis gold dragon" coin! Oooh hee hee heee.... I'm happy!!! Sooo happy!!! My precious treasure! Please enter my collection box!<br>
Ahem...! Hey! Hmm... you are a really capable fellow. I was going to pay you some money to finish our transaction. But I changed my mind. Some one with your skill is sufficiently qualified to become our member! Here! This is the cc membership 3 everybody is wanting to have. What do you think? Aren't you happy?<br>
Well, ahem... I'm going to take another look at my new treasure...<br>
