This game is played with coins. The game is a long held tradition of our coin collection society. Listen to me carefully. First, I will decide on the color and order of three coins and hide them. Then with the opportunity given to you, you will try to tell me the correct color and order of the three coins. At the end of each round, I'll tell you how many correct answers you gave. Then, use this information as a guide and try to guess the correct color and order of the three coins that are hidden by me.<br>
