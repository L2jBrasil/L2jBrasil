So, where is my coin? What? You haven't gotten it yet? If you come back empty-handed, did you think that I would praise you?! What I want is the "kaldis gold dragon" coin that Bernard has!<br>
It's not Blood DreVanul!<br>
It's not Silver Unicorn!<br>
It is the<font color="LEVEL">  Gold! Dragon! Of Kaldis!</font><br>
Understand?!!!</body></html>
