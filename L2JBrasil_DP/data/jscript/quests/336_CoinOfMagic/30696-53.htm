You've probably played a similar game before. This is an old practice of the coin collector's club. The object of the game is for you to guess the sequence of colors of three coins that I have hidden. If you call out the order appropriately, I will tell you how many you got right. This is repeated the set number of times and at the end, you tell me the answer that you have figured out. Ordinary mages play this game well.<br>
