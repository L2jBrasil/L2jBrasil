Hello there! An important person has come back! Since Grade 1 members have the privilege of dealing with many rare coins, many members are desiring to become Grade 1. However, the number of Grade 1 members is limited. To put it simply, I'm saying that Grade 1 membership is not given to just anybody who asks for it. Therefore, you should be extra careful in your words and deeds. Well now, is there anything I can help you with?<br>
