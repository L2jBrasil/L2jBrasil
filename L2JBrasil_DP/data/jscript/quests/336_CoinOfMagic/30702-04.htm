Do you think I am acquainted with such an ignorant person? Birds of a feather flock together.<br>
Anyway, one of my ancestors received this coin from someone named Kaldis. I heard that Kaldis was hiding out in the Forest of Mirrors during the time when mystics were being persecuted. However, he ended up being killed by lizardmen who inhabited the forest... If you go to this area and look for them perhaps you may stumble onto coins that are similar to this one. What do you think?</body></html>
