You are a young man that I can count on! My first impressions about you was correct! Now then, I will go ahead and explain the details.<br>
You know Bernard, the president of the Hunters Guild in this town? He is showing off a coin that he claims to be a Coin of Luck. Actually the coin is called<font color="LEVEL"> "kaldis gold dragon"</font>among us coin collectors. It is a very rare coin!<br>
Isn't it a shame that such a rare object is owned by a fool who does not understand its true value! So, I made an offer to Bernard. I would pay him a high price for giving it to me. But he stubbornly refused to hand over the coin to me. I would appreciate it if you could persuade him with some convincing words and bring back the coin to me.<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 336_CoinOfMagic 30232-05.htm">Tell him that you will bring back the coin.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 336_CoinOfMagic 30232-04.htm">Tell him that you are not interested in doing such a work.</a></body></html>
