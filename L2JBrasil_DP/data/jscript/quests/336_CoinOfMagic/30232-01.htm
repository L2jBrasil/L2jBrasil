<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Sorint:<br>
Lately, I have been feeling weak and depressed. I have found an object I really would like to possess no matter what. But there is this fool who is insisting that it is a family heirloom without knowing its true value. Just because of a stupid man like that I cannot get a hold of this treasure... I feel very frustrated! If I ask someone who is more tactful than myself, perhaps, the person will obtain the item and bring it back to me...<br>
(Only a character of level 40 or above can take on this quest.)</body></html>
