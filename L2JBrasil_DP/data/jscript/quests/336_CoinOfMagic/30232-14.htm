Ah! It feels like just a couple of days ago when you first became a member of our coin collection guild. I can't believe you are already taking up the challenge of becoming a Grade 1 member! But, I have to warn you. Attaining the grade 1 membership is as hard as plucking a star out of the sky. Although with your ability, I believe you will succeed... Please do not fail my expectations.<br>
The task is also to collect coins. If you can collect and bring back the coins I tell you now, you will pass the test.<br>
1 Silver Dryad<br>
1 Blood Basilisk<br>
1 Blood Succubus<br>
1 Silver Undine<br>
1 Gold Giant<br>
1 Gold Wyrm<br>
That's it. I look forward to seeing you back with these coins.</body></html>
