Oh, you mean the bereth's blood dragon? I can exchange a bereth's blood dragon for 10 blood basilisks and 10 blood succubus... Huh? Ah... Or would you rather play a game? That would be fine with me... I'm really strong at this game. We can exchange at a somewhat better ratio through this game that is popular at the collector's club.<br>
