This coin is an object that a long time ago, mystics instilled magic into it so that the coin would shine in each mystic's unique color. These coins were crafted by the highest skilled dwarven artisans at the time. High level magic power was bestowed upon these coins to turn them into great works of art. According to legend, mystics used these coins as their own marks. A person who helped a mystic would be given a coin as a mark of gratitude and to the one who became an enemy to a mystic, a coin was given as the mark of a curse.<br>
Actually I heard that one of my ancestors did a favor for a mystic and received this coin. Later on, there was a time when mystics were misunderstood by people as demons and many of them were killed. The coins confiscated at that time were considered objects with the mystics' curses upon them and many of them were thrown out near the places where they were executed. Nowadays, these coins have become mere collectible items of ignorant people such as Sorint.<br>
