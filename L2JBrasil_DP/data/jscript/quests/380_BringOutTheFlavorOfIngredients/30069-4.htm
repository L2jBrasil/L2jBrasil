Excellent! We must gather the ingredients! Actually, that will be the hardest part. They aren't easy to find...<br>
The fruit of the ritron trees quite often fails to sprout, and ripens underground.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dire wolves</font> have an excellent sense of smell and often dig up the<font color="LEVEL"> Ritron Fruits</font>. I will need 4 ritron fruits.<br>
I will also need a<font color="LEVEL"> Moon Face Flower</font> which is carried by<font color="LEVEL"> Kadif Werewolves</font> and some<font color="LEVEL"> Fluids of Giant Mist Leeches</font>.<br>
Ah, I will also need two leaves of Antidote as well, since Leech Fluids are very poisonous. So let's see, I need 4 Ritron Fruits, 20 Moon Flowers, 10 bottles of Giant Mist Leech Fluids and two leaves of Antidote... You can purchase Antidote at any store.<br>
Bring me these ingredients and you'll taste the best dessert in the world!<br>
