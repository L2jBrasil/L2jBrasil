This case is going in the wrong direction. I think we need to send a special guard to protect her. And we'd better report this to the High Priest.<br>
I heard your story from Master Sorius. He said that you were a great help in this case and praised you a lot.<br>
In my mind as well, I think you have already proven that you are qualified. There might come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep up with your practices for that day.<br>
By the way... The thing that you are holding in your hands...It has been bothering me... It looks just like what we have lost in the church. Can I take a look at it?<br>
