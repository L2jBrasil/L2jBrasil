Humph! I guess you're not as stupid as you look... Well, although it's only a part of it, it will lead you to the treasure of the great pirate Zaken... I know that you don't want to give up the map so easily.<br>
Hey, listen! Wouldn't you like to know what kind of treasure is hidden out there? Just the sight of that map makes my heart pound like a drum!<br>
How about this? I'll decipher and interpret the map for you, then you go and find the treasure. In exchange for my services, all i want is the treasure map. I'd like to keep it as a souvenir. What do you think?<br>
