I believe this map will lead us to the prince's gold! I wonder how that Delu Lizardman got this?<br>
If we can get to the gold before our opponents we will be able to hire soldiers and buy weapons with which to defend the village.<br>
Think of this as your last test. You must find the other parts of this map and<font color="LEVEL"> get the prince's lost gold bar</font>.<br>
Whether you are successful or not, I will write you the letter of recommendation you need.<br>
