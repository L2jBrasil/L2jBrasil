Oh, thank you! My investigation is finally going somewhere! It seems to me that there's a connection between the Sylphs... you know, those insane Wind Spirits In <font color="LEVEL">Windy Hill</font>...<br>
Unfortunately, that's as far as I've gotten with my research. Could you bring me Sylph Breath from those pesky vermin in Windy Hill? Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Sobbing Wind</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Babbling Wind</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giggling Wind</font> and the find what is known as the <font color="LEVEL">Container of Sylph Breath</font> and bring those to me. The breath of a Sylph is quite an odd thing I know... but you'll know what I'm talking about when you there...
