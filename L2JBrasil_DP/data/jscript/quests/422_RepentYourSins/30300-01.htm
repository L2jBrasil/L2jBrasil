Manacles of a Penitent...? Ah yes. A strange item, but I can make them. Funny thing, too... I've been getting a lot of orders for these lately. They must be getting popular... <BR>
I've memorized the ingredients: I'll need some Steel, an Adamantite Nugget... some silver...<BR>
Here, take this list. Verify that this is what you want to order. These are serious manacles and cannot be handled carelessly!
