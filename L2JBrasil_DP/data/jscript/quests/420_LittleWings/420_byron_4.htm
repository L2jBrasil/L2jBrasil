It's something that happened to me when I was very young and so I don't remember well, 
but... If there are still fairies living in Enchanted Valley, the location that I'm thinking 
about is<font color="LEVEL"> the deepest place in the north of the valley</font>. Take that 
fairy stone and...<br>Wait! Show me that stone again. ... This is not an ordinary fairy 
stone! It's as white as snow... This is the pure white fairy stone that fairies really 
love. But that stone is very sensitive to blood. In particular, creatures that are close 
to fairies... If it gets the blood of creatures living in Enchanted Valley on it, it will break 
immediately. And there are a lot of creatures there that don't like Humans... It's a difficult 
situation. To meet the fairy<font color="LEVEL"> you must not attack any creatures in Enchanted 
Valley</font> on your way to the very deepest part of the valley...</body></html>
