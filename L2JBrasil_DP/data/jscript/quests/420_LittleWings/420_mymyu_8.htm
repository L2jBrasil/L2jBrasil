<html><body>Fairy Mimyu:<br>OK, it appears that you've started looking for the egg. But what good is it to be standing here? 
Think how anxious its mother is waiting for the egg. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry and find the egg! I mean, those guys might 
boil it, poach it, fry it or scramble it! OK, hurry! And you know, right? If you bring me the egg, I'll definitely do you 
a favor! I'll raise the hatchling well, so just give it to me. OK? Alright, stay strong.</body></html>
