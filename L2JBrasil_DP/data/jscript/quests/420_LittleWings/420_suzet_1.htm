<html><body>Wyrm Suzet:<br>I am a cold-hearted beast. Is this the juice of monkshood…? Did Fairy Mimyu tell you that in order to 
straighten out a dull-witted wyrm, you have to pour this poison into my mouth? Throw away such dangerous stuff.<br>
If you have been sent to me by Mimyu, I guess you are the one who will find my lost eggs for me. But I guess you are 
wanting some reward for your work, right? Tell me. I will try to meet your expectations as much as possible.<br>
