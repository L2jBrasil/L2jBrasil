Oh… what the heck. Here, take this. It is the list of stuff you will need to make the fairy stone 
with. But even a highly skilled dwarven artisan won’t be able to make a fairy stone. Ahem, ahem… 
Oh yes, I heard that a young lady named<font color="LEVEL"> Maria who lives in Dion Castle Town
</font>knows how to make a specialty gem called crystal of purity. In my opinion, that young lady 
may be able to make the fairy stone also… But, what if she can’t? Well, then I don’t know 
what to say…. Rather than just worrying about it… why don’t you go ask her yourself? Oh, by the 
way, among the stuff on the list, the<font color="LEVEL"> inpicio’s back skin</font>cannot be bought 
at a store. So, you will have to go to the<font color="LEVEL"> Cruma Marshlands </font>yourself and catch a
<font color="LEVEL">toad lord</font> to collect it.</body></html>
