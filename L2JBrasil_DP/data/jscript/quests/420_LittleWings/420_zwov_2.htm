<html><body>Drake Zwov:<br>Really? Are you really here to help me? Ooh... There's some Elven dust on you! Have you come after meeting 
Fairy Mimyu? Well, then I can trust you.<br>OK, I'll tell you. The spiders stole my eggs. I don't know why they took my 
eggs.. But what makes me suspicious is that there are<font color="LEVEL"> many marsh spiders in the Cruma Marshlands</font>
... It's really wide there and I am rummaging through it very, very slowly. And so, if you're going to help me then take 
this scale of mine and go kill marsh spiders. Then all you have to do is gather the eggs with the same pattern as this 
scale.<font color="LEVEL"> 20 of them!</font> And don't come back with the likes of spider eggs! I'll also go check out 
other places. OK?</body></html>
