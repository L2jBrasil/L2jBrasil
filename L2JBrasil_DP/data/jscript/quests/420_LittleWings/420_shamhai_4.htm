<html><body>Wyrm Shamhai:<br>Oh oh…! My eggs…! My precious eggs…! Did you find all of them? Yes…! Everybody is still healthy…! 
Thank you for your hard work. You can go now…<br>… so I wish I could say. But I promised to give you one of my eggs 
right? I don’t know whether you can really become a master of my baby who is strong, brave to the point of being cruel 
and proud… But for now, I will give you a test to find out. I will give you this egg. Take it to<font color="LEVEL"> 
Fairy Mimyu </font> and ask her to hatch it. You should take good care of my child. If you starve my child or anything 
like that, I will fly to you and feed you to my child! Understand?!</body></html>
