<html><body>Wyrm Suzet:<br>… I understand. Well, if you were like one of those I am worried about, you wouldn’t have been able 
to speak with Fairy Mimyu and come and see me like this. In the name of Sayha and Antharas, if you can recover 
<font color="LEVEL">my 20 lost eggs </font>eggs that have been stolen by Breka Orcs, I promise to give one of them 
to you. Take this scale of mine with you. My eggs will have the same pattern as that of this scale so you can 
recognize them. What you need to catch are<font color="LEVEL"> Breka Orc overlords</font>… Many of them can be found 
in a place humans call<font color="LEVEL"> Giran that is located in the northern part of the land</font>. Since I 
cannot fight against multiple Breka Orcs, I will have to ask you to kill them and return my eggs to me.</body></html>
