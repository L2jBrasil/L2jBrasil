Ascalon... It is a name that I have long forgotten... After I quit my job in the army, I got married to a beautiful woman called Lillian and we settled down in my hometown of Dion where we spent some happy and peaceful days.<br>
And then one day, Grecia's army attacked and they killed my wife and children. Since then alcohol has been my only company. I often find myself crying by the riverside in grief of having to let my loved ones go...<br>
Grecia's army is my lifelong enemy because they deprived me of my most precious thing, my family.<font color="LEVEL"> I swear that I'll revenge on them.</font> Will you help me?<br>
