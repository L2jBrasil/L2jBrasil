<html><body>To be a Bounty Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to a Bounty Hunter. Keep up the good work, young one.
