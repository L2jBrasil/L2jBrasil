<html><body>To be a Bounty Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
Oh, what have you done until now? You haven't collected the marks yet? Come back after collecting all of the marks. If you collect all of them and come to me I will change your occupation to a Bounty Hunter.
