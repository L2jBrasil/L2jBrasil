<html><body>I am the Head Blacksmith who has trained famous Dwarven Warsmiths. Someone like you doesn't have anything to learn from me.<br>
However, remember this. The equipment you are currently wearing would never have existed if we, Dwarven Blacksmiths were not around. That is why Dwarven Blacksmiths are important.<br>
Ah, by any chance if you are a Scavenger go visit the Warehouse Chief. Never mind, if you are not.
