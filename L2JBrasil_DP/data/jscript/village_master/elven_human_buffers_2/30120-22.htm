To be a Prophet, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br>
You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation in to a Prophet.
