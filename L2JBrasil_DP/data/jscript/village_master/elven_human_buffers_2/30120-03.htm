Elven Elders can use both Healing Magic and Supplementary Magic. Elders are not inclined to one skill like Bishops or Prophets, and they are very useful during small party play.<br>
They have basic skills such as Supplementary Magic, increasing defense and evasion and healing allies and they can use magic to damage the undead.<br>
To be an Elder, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.<br>
