To be an Overlord, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Lord.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to an Overlord.
