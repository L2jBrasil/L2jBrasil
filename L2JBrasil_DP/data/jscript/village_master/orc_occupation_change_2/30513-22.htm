To be a Destroyer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Champion.<br>
You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all of the marks. If you fulfill these obligations, I will change your occupation to a Destroyer.
