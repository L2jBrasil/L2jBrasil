To be a Tyrant, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Duelist.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to a Tyrant.
