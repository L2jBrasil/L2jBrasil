To be a Destroyer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Champion.<br>
But what is this, you level is not high enough and you haven't even collected all of the marks. Come back after collecting the marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation to a Destroyer.
