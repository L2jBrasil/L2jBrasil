To be a Gladiator, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Duelist.
<br>
Your level is still insufficient and you don't have the 3 marks. Come back to me after more training. Come back after you have collected all 3 marks and increased your level to 40. Then I shall change your occupation to a Gladiator.
