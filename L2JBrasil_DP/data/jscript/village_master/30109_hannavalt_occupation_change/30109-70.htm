To be a Gladiator, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Duelist. Your level is sufficient, but you did not bring me all of the marks.
<br>
To change to a Gladiator, you have to bring all 3 marks I told you about when I was talking about occupations. Now, take the tests and bring me the marks.
