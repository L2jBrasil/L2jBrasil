To be a Temple Knight, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.
<br>
You have gained enough levels, but you still haven't brought me the marks. As I said when I was talking about occupations, bring me all the marks and come back to me. Then I shall change your occupation to a Temple Knight.
