To be a Necromancer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back after you have trained more. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation in to a Necromancer.
