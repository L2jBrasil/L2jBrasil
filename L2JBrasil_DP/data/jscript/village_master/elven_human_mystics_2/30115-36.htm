To be a Warlock, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Summoner.<br>
You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation to a Hexan.
