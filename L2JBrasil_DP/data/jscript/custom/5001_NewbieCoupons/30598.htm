As token of congratulations, the Adventure Guild is pleased to open its warehouse to both apprentice adventurers
who have reached level 6 as well as travelers who have completed their first occupation change.
At level 6, you can borrow a <font color="LEVEL">No-Grade Shadow Weapon</font> with the
<font color="LEVEL">Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon</font>.
At level 20, you can borrow <font color="LEVEL">Shadow Armor</font> with the
<font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Magic Armor Exchange Coupon</font>.
No-Grade Shadow Weapons can be exchanged up to level 19 and Shadow Armor can be exchanged up to level 39.
Now then: how can I help you?<br>(Note: chaotic characters may not use weapons or armor borrowed from the Adventure Guild.)<br>
