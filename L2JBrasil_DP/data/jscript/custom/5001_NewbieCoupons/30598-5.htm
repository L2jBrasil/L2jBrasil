Here is the Apprentice Adventurer's Armor Exchange Coupon.<br>
You can exchange this ticket for the No-Grade Shadow Armor from the Adventure Guild warehouse.
Keep in mind that this Exchange Coupon is reserved only for you.
Should you lose either the ticket or the weapon you borrowed, you cannot get a new one.
Guard it carefully! You can use the weapon warehouse if you visit the Newbie Guide in each town.
I wish you a pleasant and prosperous journey!
