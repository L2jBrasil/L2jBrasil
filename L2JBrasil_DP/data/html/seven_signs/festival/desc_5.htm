<font color="LEVEL">1. Awarding of Bonuses</font><br>
Bonuses are awarded to the victors of the competition. They are given in the form of <font color="FF0000">ancient adena</font>. Having the top score does not assure the bonus, the party must have also been victorious in battle. If no party in a certain level is eligible for a bonus, the bonus is divided equally between the top scorers of the other levels.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">2. Amounts of Bonuses</font><br>
All parties that participate in the festival must pay a fee. These fees are distributed as bonuses. Naturally, the more parties that participate in the festival, the greater the bonues will be.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">3. Bonus Periods</font><br>
Since some parties challenge the Festival of Darkness more then others, bonuses are not determined until the competition is complete, during the seal validation period. The leader of the highest-scoring victorious party of each level must visit the oracle to recieve the reward.<br>
