<font color="LEVEL">[Winning the Seven Signs]</font><br>
The highest-scoring group of the competition wins the Seven Signs.<br>
50% of the final score is determined by how well the group collected seal stones. This score is determined by the number of seal stones given to the priests as offerings.<br>
The remaining 50% of the final score is determined at the Festival of Darkness. Participants in the Festival of Darkness are divided into five grades, according to their level. In each grade, the party that obtains the highest score will contribute a certain score to its group.<br>
The scores for different levels applied in the Festival of Darkness are as follows:<br>
- Less than Level 32: 60<br>
- Less than Level 43: 70<br>
- Less than Level 54: 100<br>
- Less than Level 65: 120<br>
- No Level Limit: 150<br>
Scores are tallied 15 minutes after the competition is over. The seal validation period begins afterwards, at which time all the penalties and rewards are applied.<br><br>
