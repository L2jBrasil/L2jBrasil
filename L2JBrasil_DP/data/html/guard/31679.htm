!Frontier Guard Captain Eustace Van Essen:

Hey there, traveler! You wouldn't happen to be carrying out any prohibited items now, would you? We're seeing more and more smuggling across the border lately...

Hmm... Nothing out of the ordinary here, I suppose. Alright, you can go. Have a safe passage on your return trip home.

Say, if yon meet that rat Van Deik on the other side, tell him that I'll deal with him soon enough. Tell him that his days are numbered! Keuk!
