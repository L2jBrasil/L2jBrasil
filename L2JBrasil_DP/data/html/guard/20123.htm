!Bloody Pixy:

The weak sprits of darkness connot protect the forest with their own powers and are receiving assistance from the Bloody Pixies. Wretched cowards they are, hiding in the ground, afraid of light!!

Thanks to them, we deal with invaders and outlaws by our own hands. If you violate the laws here you will know why we are called the Bloody Pixies. Better be careful!!
