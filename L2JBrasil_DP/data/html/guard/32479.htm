!Guard Adios:

What do you know about Gludio Castle? It is the official residence of the lord of Gludio, of course.

But it was originally built by wise King Cadmus to deter an invasion from Gracia.

When Gracia finally did invade a few years ago, the Gludio garrison was safe and secure in the castle, and our troops were able to repel the invaders.

All thanks to the king's foresight!
