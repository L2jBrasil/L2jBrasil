Hunters Guild Member Colin:
<br>
The Hunters Guild is a brotherhood of extraordinary Hunters. We are 
professionals, constantly honing our skills... We hunt prey never 
imaginated by tipical hunters... You will know the details soon...
<br>
the Hunters Guild is a somewhat autonomous. Even though Castle Aden has 
dispatched Guards, we are capable of defending ourselves. The Guards are 
aware of this and even approve, but our town stubbornly insist that the 
Guards stay here...
<br>
It is a somewhat complicated story...
