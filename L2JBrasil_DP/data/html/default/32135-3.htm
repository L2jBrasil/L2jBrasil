Newbie Guide:
<br>
Which weapon do you use now? What kind of weapon do you want to use in 
the future? The reason why I'm asking this question is that it is 
important that you find the most suitable weapon for you when you reach 
level 6
<br>
If you think that a Dagger is the best fit, buy a 
<font color="LEVEL">
Bone Dagger 
</font>
. If you have enough money, you can also buy a Doom Dagger, but a Bone 
Dagger should be good enough. If you prefer a Sword, buy a 
<font color="LEVEL">
Short Sword 
</font>
. If you have enough money, you can also buy a Broad Sword, but a Short 
Sword should be good enough. If you want to use a blunt weapon rather 
than a knife, I recommend a 
<font color="LEVEL">
Club
</font>
. A blunt weapon has a higher accuracy rate than other weapons. A Lance, 
meanwhile, can be used to attack serveral enemies at once, while a Bow 
is ideal for remote attack.
<br>
No matter which weapon you use, though, don't forget this: you can use 
the Kamael's unique weapon after reaching level 20 and completing the 
first class transfer. If you are a Kamael male, you must be familiar 
with the Two-Handed Sword and the One-Handed Sword. If you are a Kamael 
female, you should be familiar with the One-Handed Sword and the Bow.
<br>
You will have enough money to buy the next weapon once you reach level 9 
or 10. But you'd better wait a while. As I mentioned if you take the 
test given by 
<font color="LEVEL">
Hierarch Kekropus
</font>
, he will give you a weapon.
