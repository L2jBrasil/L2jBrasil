Maestro Reorin:
<br>
Well, lets see... About 50 years ago I became the youngest blacksmith in 
the history of the Black Anvil Guild to earn the postition of Maestro! I 
truly was at the pinnacle of success!
<br>
Many heroes of that day would trust only me for thier weapons and armor. 
I made the sword of Sir Cedric Athebalt, and the spear of Helena 
Blackbird, the female general! All of my products sold for high prices 
as soon as they went on the market.
<br>
Everyone wanted to be my apprentice but I had to send most of them away. 
I eventually had over 30 apprentices working for me.
<br>
And then... I met and married the most beautifull girl in Schuttgart... 
But...
