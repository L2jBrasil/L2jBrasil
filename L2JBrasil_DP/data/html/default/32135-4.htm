Newbie Guide:
<br>
At that level, you can fight the 
<font color="LEVEL">
Green Goblin and Hill Werewolves 
</font>
. If you are skilled at hunting, you can also fight the 
<font color="LEVEL">
Muertos Archer 
</font>
or 
<font color="LEVEL">
Mountain Fungus.
</font>
<br>
You can find them at the center of the island, south of the town. It is 
called the 
<font color="LEVEL">
Hills of Gold. 
</font>
You can find there every monster that I've mentioned. Before going 
there, though, visit Captain 
<font color="LEVEL">
Zerstorer Marcela. 
</font>
If you catch a monster on Hills of Gold, he will reward you. I don't 
know what you're doing know. but it will benefit you.
<br>
By the way, be careful of the Muertos who are wandering around Hills of 
Gold -- they are no easy target, whatever their appearance. Fight them 
only after you have reached level 11.
