Maestro Reorin:
<br>
It was the evil Death Lord Hallate. He who leads the army of darkness... 
He who is known as the insolent invader or the archenemy of the angels. 
He made me an offer that I couldn't refuse. He promised me that he would 
help me to create a masterpiece that would go down in history. Ignoring 
the entreaties of my darling wife I went along with it... and fell into 
the demon's trap...
<br>
This led to his taking of my beloved wife Reiria... Hicupp~!
<br>
Oh, what the?! I can't bear to think of it anymore! Hiccup~!
<br>
Please leave me alone!
