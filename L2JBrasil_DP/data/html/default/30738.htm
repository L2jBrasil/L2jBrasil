Alchemist Matild:
<br>
Don't you think it's pure prejudice to say that Dwarves can't use magic? 
I have been interested in alchemy ever since I was young and even went 
for study at the Ivory Tower. And I left school because of an 
unavoidable situation... No, I had to quit in the middle of my studies 
but still I studied really hard while I was there.
