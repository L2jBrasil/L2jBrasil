Newbie Guide:
<br>
At this level, if you prefer to use a speceific attack skill, train hard 
to enhance that skill. Upgrade the ones you already use most when you 
become level 10.
<br>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first and only later learn 
support skills. Therefore, it may be helpful to learn passive skills 
like 
<font color="LEVEL">
Weapon Mastery, Armor Mastery, Magic Immunity 
</font>
or 
<font color="LEVEL">
Soul Mastery. 
</font>
I also recommend that you learn 
<font color="LEVEL">
Rapid Attack, 
</font>
which temporarily enhances your attack power.
