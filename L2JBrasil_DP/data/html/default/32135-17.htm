Newbie Guide:
<br>
A 
<font color="LEVEL">
Two-Handed Sword or Two-Handed Blunt Weapon 
</font>
possesses both formidable power and reach compared to their one-handed 
counterparts. That power comes at the price of quickness, however.
<br>
The weapons are a good choice for these who rely on inflicting devasting 
damage in combat. But if you wish to purchase them, you'd better raise 
your level and save your money! Of course, the differences specified 
between the One-Handed Sword and the One-Handed Blunt Weapon apply to 
the two-handed versions as well.
