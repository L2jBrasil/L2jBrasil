Newbie Guide:
<br>
The 
<font color="LEVEL">
One-Handed Sword 
</font>
is the most basic weapon in the game, prossessing balanced attributes. 
The Squire's Sword you began your adventures with was one of these. 
Unless you prefer a specific weapon. I recommend staying with a 
One-Handed Sword.
<br>
You can also use 
<font color="LEVEL">
allen Atack 
</font>
with it, which will allow you to strike a critical blow to enemies.
