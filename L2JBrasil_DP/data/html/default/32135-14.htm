Newbie Guide:
<br>
If you have hunted well, you can equip yourself with good armor. 
Otherwise, you will have to upgrade gradually. Once you've reached level 
6, you can wear Apprentice's Shoes, Cloth Caps and Short Gloves with 
your armor.
<br>
If you are particularty lucky, you may acquire a full set of leather 
armors. SOme warriors think a wapon is more important than armor, so 
they only focus on buying weapons. But I think it is better to 
systematically upgrade both weapons and armor.
<br>
Finally, I'll tell you about a Shield. While it certainly can reduce the 
damage you take, it will slow you down and isn't suitable for some 
missions. If you have a job that requires that you wear heavy armor, a 
shield is necessary. For other jobs for which a Dagger and light armor 
are better, a Shield will only be a burden
