<html><body>High Prefect Lambac:<br>
This camp is hailed far and wide and the best training camp in the kingdom for warriors. Bah! These fragile Humans and delicate Elflings know nothing of real training! I, High Prefect Lambac, am already beside myself with the frustration of dealing with these lesser races. If I exert even a little strength, I snap their bones like a sparrow's or cause them to go faint from pain that even an Orc child would laugh at!<br>
Tejakar Oroka! True training must be between Orcs!
