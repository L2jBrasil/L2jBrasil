Welcome to the Heine, the city of water...or at least be as welcome as you can be in place like this. True Orcs like me can never feel at home in a city like this, with its bright buildings and stinking Elves. I feel like firecracker thrown into water!<br>
Ah, but we do what must be done... So, why have you come looking for me?<br>
