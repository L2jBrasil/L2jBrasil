I'll tell you why. you may be surprised to learn 
that i am a member of the Tactics Corps. You 
see this fortress? Places just like it used to 
protect the people of this land from he Monsters and 
foreign armies. And now? Greedy, grasping fools 
have accupied the fortress, using its might to 
extort money from the area residents... So I'm 
guarding this area, searching for someone 
worthy to defeat that band of bandits and occupy 
the fortress on behalf of the citizens here. 
<br>
You seem a likely candidate... What do you say? 
You could hire our mercenaries, and with our 
help I'm sure you'd be able to capture the 
fortress. Do you want to try?
