Uh-huh. I occasionally earn a few Adena as 
mercenary... A single mission earns me 250,000 
Adena. Not a particularly expensive fee, 
considering that I put my life on the line!

But I get your point. If there is an enemy clan 
controlling the fortress, I'll escort our mercenary 
captain here. He can open the Barracks' gate, so 
be sure to guard him carefully.
