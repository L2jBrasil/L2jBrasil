### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must know that L2jBrasil Project is licensed under the
[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/L2jBrasil/L2jBrasil/blob/master/LICENSE)
, and you must agree with terms. Understand that license is necessary mainly because you 
own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code under our LICENSE.
We also need to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents/licenses. You don't have to physical sign
the LICENSE, it will be done when you submit your code for review and a member has
approved it, you can denny but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/L2jBrasil/L2jBrasil/issues) with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/L2jBrasil/L2jBrasil/pulls) for this purpose.
